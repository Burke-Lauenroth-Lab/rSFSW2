\title{Re-aggregation of spatial polygon data by spatial rectangles/polygons}
\usage{
reaggregate_shapefile(x, by, fields = NULL, code = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \linkS4class{SpatialPolygons} object from which data are extracted.}

\item{by}{A \linkS4class{SpatialPolygons} object. The 'extents' representing the
rectangle(s) for which data are re-aggregated.}

\item{fields}{A character vector. If not \code{NULL}, then \code{fields} selects
columns of the extracted object.}

\item{code}{A vector. If not \code{NULL}, then the extracted data are treated as
integer codes of a factor whose levels are encoded by \code{code}.}
}
\value{
A list of length corresponding to the number of rectangles. Each element is a
 list which contains three items each
 \describe{
   \item{N}{An integer vector. The number of unique values within the rectangle for
     each layer of \code{x}.}
   \item{values}{A list of numeric vectors or matrices. The sorted unique values as
     vector or matrix for each layer.}
   \item{weigths}{A list of numeric vectors. The weights of the \code{values} for each
     layer.}
 }
}
\description{
Code based on \code{\link[sp]{aggregatePolyWeighted}} version 1.2.3 and modified to
 return complete information and not the area-weighted sum.
