\title{Extract all raster cell values that occur within each rectangle}
\usage{
reaggregate_raster(x, coords, to_res = c(0, 0), with_weights = NULL,
  method = c("raster", "raster_con", "block"), tol = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \linkS4class{raster*} object from which data are extracted.}

\item{coords}{A numeric vector of length two or a matrix with two columns. The x and
y coordinates of the center(s) of the rectangle(s).}

\item{to_res}{A numeric vector of length two. The x- and y-extent of the rectangle(s).}

\item{with_weights}{A logical value or \code{NULL}. If \code{NULL}, then code attempts
to determine whether weights are required for the call to
\code{\link[raster]{extract}}.}

\item{method}{A character string. Selects the extraction method, see details.}

\item{tol}{A numeric value. The absolute tolerance for deviation used if
\code{is.null(with_weights)}.}
}
\value{
A list of length corresponding to the number of rectangles. Each element is a
 list which contains three items each
 \describe{
   \item{N}{An integer vector. The number of unique values within the rectangle for
     each layer of \code{x}.}
   \item{values}{A list of numeric vectors. The sorted unique values as vector for
     each layer.}
   \item{weigths}{A list of numeric vectors. The weights of the \code{values} for each
     layer.}
 }
}
\description{
This is similar to \code{\link[raster]{aggregate}} but with more control and information.
}
\details{
Available extraction \code{method}s include
 \describe{
    \item{raster}{Uses the function \code{\link[raster]{extract}}}
    \item{raster_con}{Uses the function \code{extract2_Raster_SpatialPolygons}.
       This is a modified version of \code{\link[raster]{extract}} where the
       'connection' to the raster file is open for the entire extraction call and
       not re-opened/closed for each read event. This allows a massive speed-up which
       scales with the number of 'rectangles' to be extracted [not implemented].}
    \item{block}{Uses the function \code{extract_blocks}.}
  }
The weighted mean of the extracted values can be calculated as
 stats::weighted.mean(values, w = weights)
}
