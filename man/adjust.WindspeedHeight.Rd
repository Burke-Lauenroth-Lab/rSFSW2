\name{adjust.WindspeedHeight}
\alias{adjust.WindspeedHeight}
\title{Function to extrapolate windspeeds measured at a height different from the
2-m above ground that are assumed by \pkg{SOILWAT2}}
\usage{
adjust.WindspeedHeight(uz, height)
}
\arguments{
\item{uz}{A numeric vector. Windspeed [m/s] at \code{height}.}

\item{height}{A numeric value. Height above ground at which \code{uz} windspeed was
measured.}
}
\value{
Windspeed [m/s] at a height of 2 m above ground.
}
\description{
Based on equation 33 in Allen et al. 2005. Note: "For wind measurements above surfaces
 other than clipped grass, the user should apply the full logarithmic equation B.14".
