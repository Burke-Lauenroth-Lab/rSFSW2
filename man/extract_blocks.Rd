\title{Extract values from \linkS4class{Raster*} objects that are covered by an
extent rectangle.}
\usage{
extract_blocks(x, y, weights = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Raster* object}

\item{y}{A matrix with four columns: \var{\dQuote{xmin}}, \var{\dQuote{xmax}},
\var{\dQuote{ymin}}, \var{\dQuote{ymax}}; each row represents the corners of an
\code{\linkS4class{Extent}} object.}

\item{weights}{logical. If \code{TRUE} and \code{normalizeWeights=FALSE}, the function returns, for each polygon, a matrix with the cell values and the approximate fraction of each cell that is covered by the polygon(rounded to 1/100). If \code{TRUE} and  \code{normalizeWeights=TRUE} the weights are normalized such that they add up to one. The weights can be used for averaging; see examples. This option can be useful (but slow) if the polygons are small relative to the cells size of the Raster* object}
}
\value{
A list with one item for each extent of \code{y}.
  Each element is a matrix where each row corresponds to one of the cells of \code{x}
  and where columns correspond to layers of \code{x}.
 If \code{weights} is \code{TRUE}, then an additional last column is added which
}
\description{
A cell is covered if its center is inside the polygon (but see the weights option for
 considering partly covered cells).
