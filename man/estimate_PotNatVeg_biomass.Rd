\usage{
estimate_PotNatVeg_biomass(tr_VegBiom, do_adjBiom_by_temp = FALSE,
  do_adjBiom_by_ppt = FALSE, fgrass_c3c4ann = c(1, 0, 0),
  growing_limit_C = 4, isNorth = TRUE, MAP_mm = 450,

}
\arguments{
\item{tr_VegBiom}{A data.frame with 12 rows (one for each month) and columns
\code{X.Biomass}, \code{X.Amount.Live}, \code{X.Perc.Live}, and
\code{X.Litter} where \code{X} are for the functional groups shrubs,
\code{X = Sh}; C3-grasses, \code{X = C3}; C4-grasses, \code{X = C4}; and
annuals, \code{X = Annual} containing default input values.}

\item{do_adjBiom_by_temp}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE} then monthly
phenology is adjusted by temperature.}

\item{do_adjBiom_by_ppt}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE} then monthly biomass
is adjusted by precipitation.}

\item{fgrass_c3c4ann}{A numeric vector of length 3. Relative contribution
[0-1] of the C3-grasses, C4-grasses, and annuals functional groups. The sum
of \code{fgrass_c3c4ann} is 1.}

\item{growing_limit_C}{A numeric value. Mean monthly temperatures equal or
above this limit are here considered suitable for growth (growing season).
Default value is 4 C.}

\item{isNorth}{A logical value. \code{TRUE} for locations on northern
hemisphere.}

\item{MAP_mm}{A numeric value. Mean annual precipitation in millimeter of the
location.}

\item{mean_monthly_temp_C}{A numeric vector of length 12. Mean monthly
temperature in Celsius. The default inputs considered March-October as
growing season.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements \code{grass}, \code{shrub}. Each element is
  a matrix with 12 rows (one for each month) and columns \code{Biomass},
  \code{Amount.Live}, \code{Perc.Live}, and \code{Litter}.

\section{Default inputs}{
 \itemize{
  \item Shrubs are based on location \var{\sQuote{IM_USC00107648_Reynolds}}
    which resulted in a vegetation composition of 70 \% shrubs and 30 \%
    C3-grasses. Default monthly biomass values were estimated for
    MAP = 450 mm yr-1.
  \item Grasses are based on location \var{\sQuote{GP_SGSLTER}}
    (shortgrass steppe) which resulted in 12 \% shrubs, 22 \% C3-grasses,
    and 66 \% C4-grasses. Default biomass values were estimated for
    MAP = 340 mm yr-1. }
