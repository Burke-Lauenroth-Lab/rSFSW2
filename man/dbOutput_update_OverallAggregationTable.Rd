\title{Add fields to an existing \var{\sQuote{dbOutput}}}
\usage{
dbOutput_update_OverallAggregationTable(SFSW2_prj_meta, col_ids = NULL,
  chunksize = 1000, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{SFSW2_prj_meta}{See elsewhere}

\item{col_ids}{An integer vector. If \code{NULL} then the code will match old and new
fields automatically. If not \code{NULL} and its length is equal to the number of
fields in the old table, then this information is used to transfer data. Possible use
case: field names have changed, but they represent the same output.}

\item{chunksize}{An integer value. Chunks used to transfer data to the new table.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value.}
}
\description{
You realize that you want additional output fields after starting a simulation project;
or, the package is updated while you are working on a simulation, and produces now
additional output fields for output options that are active in your simulation project.
In either case, you don't want to discard data that is already in
\var{\sQuote{dbOutput}}.
